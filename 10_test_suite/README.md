# Test Suite for MazeRun

To run the test, the directory with this file needs to be in the PYTHONPATH.

On Linux, this can be done with:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:your_project_dir/maze_run/10_test_suite/

And then run the entire test suite from the same directory with:

    py.test


Or play the game with

    python maze_run
